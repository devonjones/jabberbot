This repo is a copy of Python-JabberBot adding some features I need.

Added features include:
* Ability to work with Google Apps for Domains accounts
* Ability to override handling of contacts that behave like MUCs (partych.at)
* Ability to trigger behavior post subscribe and unsubscribe events
* Ability to pass in a list of domains for use with privatedomain
* Added a return value to serve_forever to make it easy to tell if an exit was intentional
